  <h1>BUDDY'S ANIMAL SHELTER</h1>
  <h2>Look at all these babies who need homes. Get your lazy butt out here and adopt some fur-babies.</h2>

      <h2>BABARA THE LLAMA</h2>
      <p>She just finished her masters in computer science. This one will be bringing in the big bucks so you best move fast.</p>

      <h2>SAMMY THE GIRAFFE</h2>
      <p>We recently caught him eating bananas without pealing them. Not sure if that's impressive or disturbing, you be the judge.</p>

    <h2>TINY THE BLUE WHALE</h2>
    <p>Tiny is the runt of the litter, but you'll still need to have at least two acres of water to adopt her. She's lovely though, don't let the size bother you</p>
